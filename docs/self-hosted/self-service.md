# Self-service passthrough token

Self-hosted instances can use the official Zentik cloud to deliver push notifications to iOS (and optionally other providers) without configuring APNs, certificates, or Firebase yourself. To do this you need a **passthrough token**.

## Steps

1. **Request a token**  
   Go to the [self-service token request page](https://notifier.zentik.app/self-service/token-requests) and submit a request.

2. **Wait for confirmation**  
   Once your request is approved, the token will be available to your account.

3. **Use the token in the app**  
   As an **admin** user, open **Server settings** in the app. The approved token will appear in a **selector**. Select it to enable **iOS passthrough** (and optionally other passthrough options) for your self-hosted instance.

After you select the token, your backend will use the Zentik cloud only as a bridge to deliver notifications; content remains encrypted and is not stored. See [Settings - Push Passthrough](./settings.md#push-passthrough) for the related server settings.
